# Optional: Add other libraries if your other simulators explicitly use them
# scipy # Often used for more advanced mathematical operations, e.g., interpolation, integration
# plotly # If you want to use interactive plots (Plotly Express, Plotly Graph Objects)
# openpyxl # If any simulator reads/writes .xlsx files
# scikit-learn # If Smart HVAC or other projects involve machine learning
# fluids # For more advanced pipe flow calculations (if not doing from scratch)
# CoolProp # For thermodynamic properties (if not using ideal gas/simple models)
